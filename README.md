Nelson rules are a method in process control of determining whether some measured variable is out of control
(unpredictable versus consistent). Rules for detecting "out-of-control" or non-random conditions were first
postulated by [Walter A. Shewhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_A._Shewhart) in the 1920s.
The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an
[article by Lloyd S Nelson](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224065.1984.11978921).

The rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time.
The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.
