Rules for detecting \"out-of-control\" or non-random conditions were first postulated by Walter A. Shewhart in the 1920s. The Nelson rules were first published in the October 1984 issue of the Journal of Quality Technology in an article by Lloyd S Nelson.\n\nThe rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.\n\nMore information on the Nelson Rules are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_rules\n\nAll rule methods in this module accept the same type of argument and return the same type of return value:\n\nArguments\n\nseries::Real[] : A timeseries vector to check for rule violation. Each entry is for a single unit of time.\n\nReturns\n\nZip{Tuple{Intp[],Int[]}}: An iterator of indices and sequence length of sequences that violate the particular Nelson Rule.\n\nSee the individual method documentation for rule description, examples and nuances.\n\nMethods are named ruleN where N goes from 1-8.  To make it easier to call multiple rules programmatically, methods may also be called via rule(::Val{N}, series) where N goes from 1-8.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"index.html#Rules","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"Rules","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","text":"Modules=[NelsonRules]\nOrder=[:function]\nPublic=false","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule1-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s2\"} where var\"#s2\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule1","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 1: One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.\n\nProblem Indicated: One or more samples are grossly out of control.\n\nThe sequence length in the return value will always be 1.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, -205, 9, -10, 12, 13, 200, 10, -5, 8, 3, -5, 5, 3, 9, -12, 17])\nzip([7, 12], [1, 1])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule2-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s1\"} where var\"#s1\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule2","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 2: Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean.\n\nProblem Indicated: Some prolonged bias exists.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule2([39, 398, 4, 76, 435, 188, 236, 283, 481, 271, 270, 274, 270, 272, 273, 273, 271, 271, 384, 194, 57, 232, 494, 468, 417, 104, 323, 469, 136, 214, 393, 267, 160, 385, 253, 155, 289, 455, 104, 289, 138, 184, 356, 186, 146, 268, 76, 258])\nzip([8], [12])\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule2([26, 31, 46, 47, 81, 6, 88, 23, 73, 1, 66, 73, 6, 84, 70, 36, 80, 94, 63, 37, 62, 84, 53, 54, 80, 75, 26, 56, 48, 3, 6, 56, 21, 43, 87, 28, 47, 73, 63, 48, 68, 60, 63, 70, 60, 67, 61, 61, 66])\nzip([41], [9])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule3-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s1\"} where var\"#s1\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule3","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 3: Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing).\n\nProblem Indicated: A trend exists.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule3([62, 79, 70, 81, 82, 83, 84, 87, 13, 83, 32, 5, 13, 36, 93, 74, 34, 20, 69, 96, 98, 101, 104, 107, 110])\nzip([3, 18], [6, 8])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule4-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s1\"} where var\"#s1\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule4","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 4: Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing.\n\nProblem Indicated: This much oscillation is beyond noise.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule4([1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2])\nzip([1], [14])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule5-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s5\"} where var\"#s5\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule5","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 5: Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction.\n\nProblem Indicated: There is a medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control.\n\nNote that the same sequence might show up for consecutive points as 2 out of 3 points can occur in two separate groups of 3 points.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule5([1524, 1583, 2284, -882, 2184, -485, 57, -13, -3494, -3150, 1148, 2182, -953, 863, -31, -621, 947, -65, 323, -237])\nzip([8, 9], [2, 2])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule6-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s1\"} where var\"#s1\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule6","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 6: Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction.\n\nProblem Indicated: There is a strong tendency for samples to be slightly out of control.\n\nExample\n\njulia> NelsonRules.rule6([816, 555, 712, 883, 397, 717, 165, 135, 261, 751, 1765, 1858, 1395, 1263, 1969, 253, 783, 631, 145, 924, -914, -701, -361, -590, 252, 848, 371, 546, 113, 984])\nzip([10, 11, 12, 20, 21], [4, 5, 4, 4, 4])\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"index.html#NelsonRules.rule7-Tuple{AbstractVector{var\"#s4\"} where var\"#s4\"<:Real}","page":"NelsonRules.jl Documentation","title":"NelsonRules.rule7","text":"Detects violation of nelson rule 7: Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean.\n\nProblem Indicated: With 1 standard deviation, greater variation would be expected.\n\nThe sequence length in the return value will always be 15.
